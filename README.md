## 1. Description of the project:

The recipe book app allows users to create accounts to save and organize their personal recipes. They can add new recipes with details like title, ingredients, instructions, and an image. 

Recipes can also be tagged with categories for easy filtering. 

Users can view a list of all their recipes, search for specific ones, and open up individual recipes to see the details. Recipes can be edited or deleted as needed.

## 5. Setup:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4. 


## 6. Technologies Used:

1. Angular 15.2.4.
2. NodeJS
3. Bootstrap styleing
4. Postman


## 7. Routes structure:

1. path: 'home', component: HomeComponent 
2. path: 'login', component: LoginComponent 
3. path: 'logout', component: LogoutComponent 
4. path: 'register', component: RegisterComponent
5. path: 'recipes', component: RecipesListComponent 
6. path: 'add', component: AddRecipeComponent 


## 8. Steps:

1) Generate new app and modules/components
2) Create recipe model and service to call API
3) Build out recipe list view
4) Implement recipe detail component
5) Develop add/edit recipe forms
6) Implement routing and navigation
7) Add input validation and error handling
8) Write unit tests for components and services
9) Add styling/UI polish with CSS/framework
10) Use Git feature branching workflow


## 9. Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## 10. Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## 11. Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## 12. Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## 13.  end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## 14. Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.


## 15. Extra Information :

Frist, generate components for recipe list, recipe details, add/edit recipe forms, navigation, etc. Then, build reactive forms for handling user input like adding recipes. Also, create a recipe service to fetch data from the backend API. Use route guards to protect certain routes like edit recipe. Then, handle form validation and display error messages. Last, add bootstrap for styling and layout.


## 16. Future Work:

1. I will add more images to represent the recipe.
2. I will use search button to search quickly for the recipes.
